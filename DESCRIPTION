Description: The message you want to communicate in a figure can easily be lost
		if the formatting and layout is bad. The book "Trees, maps, and theorems --
		Effective communication for rational minds" by Jean-luc Doumont offers
		guidelines and practical advice on how to maximize readability and clarity,
		to help you get the point across to your audience.
    This package implements some of its guidelines as themes for ggplot.
